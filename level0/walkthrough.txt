    
- you can see here it is accessing the argv of the program 
    - mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]
- then getting the second argument from argv (argv[1])
    - add    eax,0x4
- loading it into the argument of atoi and compare the return value of atoi with 0x1a7
    - mov    eax,DWORD PTR [eax]
    - mov    DWORD PTR [esp],eax
    - call   0x8049710 <atoi>
    - cmp    eax,0x1a7
- for getting the flag to this level you just you need to pass  423 (0x1a7) as argument to the excutable
