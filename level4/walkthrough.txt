- we can understand from reading asm, and the output of the decompiler
- There is a Format string vulnerability
- to pass the level we need to change value of a variable that exists at this address 0x8049810 to this value 0x1025544 
- we can see that fgets limit to reading only 0x200 bytes
- we are going to use the simple attack with "%n"
- but how we are going to write 0x1025544 ? 
  - we are going to use the padding feature that printf format provide to us
  - %60x will write the hexadecimal of the address and append to it until it's size is 60 

- you will find the payload that  write  0x1025544 in payload.txt and write to the variable using the %n specifier
